To quantify samples in with SRA project name compiled in recount2, the process is as follows:

```{r}
library(recountNNLS)
project = 'SRP063581'
pheno = processPheno(project)

## Extract the exonic counts for modeling
counts_ex = getExCounts(pheno)
## Extract the junction counts for modeling
counts_jx = getJxCounts(project)
rse_tx = recountNNLS(pheno, counts_ex, counts_jx, cores=20)

```

Otherwise, to supply your own project's output from rail for this NNLS model:

```{r}
base='/dcl01/leek/data/ta_poc/geuvadis/simulation/37_1/rail/rail-rna_out/'
manifest = data.frame(run = c("sample_01", "sample_02", "sample_03", "sample_04"), 
                      bigwig_path = c('coverage_bigwigs/sample_01.bw', 'coverage_bigwigs/sample_02.bw', 
                               'coverage_bigwigs/sample_03.bw', 'coverage_bigwigs/sample_04.bw'),
                      avg_read_length = c(37, 37, 37, 37))
junction_path =  '/dcl01/leek/data/ta_poc/geuvadis/simulation/37_1/rail/rail-rna_out/cross_sample_results/junctions.tsv.gz'
manifest$bigwig_path = paste0(base, manifest$bigwig_path)
pheno = processPheno(manifest)
counts_ex = getExCounts(pheno)
counts_jx = getJxCounts(junction_path)


```
