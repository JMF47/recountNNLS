\title{NNLS for Tx Abundance Calculation}
\usage{
recountNNLS(pheno, jx_file = NULL, counts_ex = NULL, counts_jx = NULL,
  cores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{pheno}{The table of phenotype information from processPheno().}

\item{jx_file}{The path to the Rail-RNA junction coverage file if processing sample not already in recount2.}

\item{counts_ex}{The matrix of exonic feature counts where each row represents a exonic feature and each column a sample.
If set to NULL the function will automatically compile the matrix using the information in pheno. Defaults to NULL}

\item{counts_jx}{The matrix of junction feature counts where each row represents a junction feature and each column a sample.
If set to NULL the function will automatically compile the matrix using the information in pheno or the jx_file parameter. Defaults to NULL}

\item{cores}{The number of processing cores to use.}
}
\value{
Returns an rse object of the estimated number of reads and the associated standard errors.
Each row represents a protein-coding gene, and each column represents a sample in the phenotype matrix.
}
\description{
This function applies NNLS to calculate the transcript abundance
from coverage of exonic and junction coverage statistics for samples
annotated in a phenotype matrix created using processPheno().
}
\examples{
project = 'SRP063581'
pheno = processPheno(project)
