\title{NNLS for Tx Abundance Calculation}
\usage{
recountNNLS(pheno, counts_ex, counts_jx, cores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{pheno}{The table of phenotype information from processPheno().}

\item{counts_ex}{The counts of exonic features from getExCounts().}

\item{counts_jx}{The counts of junctions from getJxCounts().}

\item{cores}{The number of processing cores to use.}
}
\description{
This function applies NNLS to calculate the Tx abundance
from coverage of exonic and junction coverage statistics extracted using getExCounts()
and getJxCounts().
